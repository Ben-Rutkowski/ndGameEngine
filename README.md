# ndGameEngine

 ndGameEngine a real-time rendering engine prototype originally built using OpenGL. The ndGameEngine application structure uses abstract module layers, ignorant of each other, that interact through a ubiquitous event system.

 October 2023 update:
 - Currently supports a rudimentary mesh editing system. Can select vertices with a select box and select faces of vertices by clicking on face. Can translate selected points through space. Prototype extrude face function.
