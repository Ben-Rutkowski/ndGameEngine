# ndGameEngine

 ndGameEngine a real-time rendering engine prototype originally built using OpenGL. Because OpenGL is depricated for the M2 chip, ndGameEngine is currently being reframed using Apple's  Metla framework. Thus any machine that wants to compile the source code must support the Metal framework. The ndGameEngine application structure uses abstract module layers, ignorant of each other, that interact through a ubiquitous event system.

 October 2023 update:
 - Currently supports a rudimentary mesh editing system. Can select vertices with a select box and select faces of vertices by clicking on face. Can translate selected points through space. Prototype extrude face function.
