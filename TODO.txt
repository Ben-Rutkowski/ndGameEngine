TODO: 
== Imidiate tasks

- Translate Axis tool
- Clean inefficient camera and edit_camera routines
- Selecting that is bounded by visible vertices. (Don't highlight obscured vertices)
- Selecting edges and faces.
- Optimize camera controls. (get rid of slowing valid checks and minimize needed functions)
- Docs

- Dynamic gridlines
- User Framebuffers for custom resolution.
- View/Edit Modes: Vertex, Edge, Face.
- Editing tools for models

        SELECTING
        - edge
        - face
        - Vertex (exclude those hidden by faces)
        - edge loops
        - face loops

        TOOLS FOR EDITING
        - Translation
        - Scale face or about center of gravity
        - Extrude face along normal or along Axis
        - Inset Face (Create an inner ring in the center)
        - Subdivide
        - Bevel edge
        - Edge slide and Vert slide

        - Glueing Meshes

        - Mirroring for symmetry

- Possibly Change events queue to take ref and not ptr
- Tidy Docs

- Camera Object ( optimize pitchYaw, so it doesnt use trig )
- Rendering basic scences
