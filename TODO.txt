++++++++++++++++ OVERHAUL ENTIRE FUCKING APP TO COCOA ++++++++++++++

- Change the ndModule implementation. the base case is not templated, only implementations are templated.
- Callbacks and Events with data

- Resizing
- Test 3D Line

++++++++++++++++ OVERHAUL ENTIRE FUCKING APP TO COCOA ++++++++++++++

- Face Mode and Wire Mode
- Logging operations to allow undo
- Extrude Faces 
- Subdivide

- Faces have dynamic sets, so have a thing where when creating n-faces, check to see if
        the sets are full, otherwise, getForce will not work. (Have getForce raise an error)
- Rendering type, face or wire.
- Translate Axis tool
- Clean inefficient camera and edit_camera routines
- Selecting edges.
- Optimize camera controls. (get rid of slowing valid checks and minimize needed functions)
- Docs

- Dynamic gridlines
- User Framebuffers for custom resolution.
- View/Edit Modes: Vertex, Edge, Face.
- Editing tools for models

        SELECTING
        - edge
        - face
        - Vertex (exclude those hidden by faces)
        - edge loops
        - face loops

        TOOLS FOR EDITING
        - Translation
        - Scale face or about center of gravity
        - Extrude face along normal or along Axis
        - Inset Face (Create an inner ring in the center)
        - Subdivide
        - Bevel edge
        - Edge slide and Vert slide

        - Glueing Meshes

        - Mirroring for symmetry
        - 

== Tidy/Optimizing ==
- Possibly Change events queue to take ref and not ptr
- Tidy Docs

== Rendering ==
- Camera Object ( optimize pitchYaw, so it doesnt use trig )
- Rendering basic scences

== Game ==
- Entities

== UI ==
- GUI Layers
    - FreeText
