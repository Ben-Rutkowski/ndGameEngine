TODO: 
== Imidiate tasks

- Change faces to use a hash map instead of a a vector
- hash maps change to dynamic and get rid of the helper table check if empty,
        have it point to the null square, and have remove/replace options
- Buttons for select type (hold control to add more to select).
- Rendering type, face or wire.
- Clean up edit mesh and others
- Translate Axis tool
- Clean inefficient camera and edit_camera routines
- Selecting edges.
- Optimize camera controls. (get rid of slowing valid checks and minimize needed functions)
- Docs

- Dynamic gridlines
- User Framebuffers for custom resolution.
- View/Edit Modes: Vertex, Edge, Face.
- Editing tools for models

        SELECTING
        - edge
        - face
        - Vertex (exclude those hidden by faces)
        - edge loops
        - face loops

        TOOLS FOR EDITING
        - Translation
        - Scale face or about center of gravity
        - Extrude face along normal or along Axis
        - Inset Face (Create an inner ring in the center)
        - Subdivide
        - Bevel edge
        - Edge slide and Vert slide

        - Glueing Meshes

        - Mirroring for symmetry
        - 

== Tidy/Optimizing ==
- Possibly Change events queue to take ref and not ptr
- Tidy Docs

== Rendering ==
- Camera Object ( optimize pitchYaw, so it doesnt use trig )
- Rendering basic scences

== Game ==
- Entities

== UI ==
- GUI Layers
    - FreeText
